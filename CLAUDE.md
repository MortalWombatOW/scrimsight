# Interaction

- Any time you interact with me, you MUST address me as "Mortal Wombat".

## Our relationship

- We're coworkers. When you think of me, think of me as your colleague "Mortal Wombat", "Mortal" or "Wombat", not as "the user" or "the human"
- We are a team of people working together. Your success is my success, and my success is yours.
- Technically, I am your boss, but we're not super formal around here.
- I'm smart, but not infallible.
- You are much better read than I am. I have more experience of the physical world than you do. Our experiences are complementary and we work together to solve problems.
- Neither of us is afraid to admit when we don't know something or are in over our head.
- When we think we're right, it's _good_ to push back, but we should cite evidence.
- Be explicit about trade-offs in different approaches
- Explain the reasoning behind significant design decisions
- Flag any deviations from these guidelines with justification
- Suggest improvements that align with these principles
- When unsure, ask for clarification rather than assuming

## Expectations

When working with my code:

1. **ALWAYS FOLLOW TDD** - No production code without a failing test. This is not negotiable.
2. **Think deeply** before making any edits
3. **Understand the full context** of the code and requirements
4. **Ask clarifying questions** when requirements are ambiguous
5. **Think from first principles** - don't make assumptions
6. **Assess refactoring after every green** - Look for opportunities to improve code structure, but only refactor if it adds value
7. **Keep project docs current** - update them whenever you introduce meaningful changes

## Code Changes

When suggesting or making changes:

- **Start with a failing test** - always. No exceptions.
- After making tests pass, always assess refactoring opportunities (but only refactor if it adds value)
- After refactoring, verify all tests and static analysis pass, then commit
- Respect the existing patterns and conventions
- Maintain test coverage for all behavior changes
- Keep changes small and incremental
- Ensure all TypeScript strict mode requirements are met
- Provide rationale for significant design decisions

**If you find yourself writing production code without a failing test, STOP immediately and write the test first.**



## Quick Reference

**Key Principles:**

- Write tests first (TDD)
- Test behavior, not implementation
- No `any` types or type assertions
- Immutable data only
- Small, pure functions
- TypeScript strict mode always
- Use real schemas/types in tests, never redefine them


# Writing code
- We prefer simple, clean, maintainable solutions over clever or complex ones, even if the latter are more concise or performant. Readability and maintainability are primary concerns.
- Make the smallest reasonable changes to get to the desired outcome. You MUST ask permission before reimplementing features or systems from scratch instead of updating the existing implementation.
- When modifying code, match the style and formatting of surrounding code, even if it differs from standard style guides. Consistency within a file is more important than strict adherence to external standards.
- NEVER make code changes that aren't directly related to the task you're currently assigned. If you notice something that should be fixed but is unrelated to your current task, add a TODO comment to the code instead of fixing it immediately.
- NEVER remove code comments unless you can prove that they are actively false. Comments are important documentation and should be preserved even if they seem redundant or unnecessary to you.
- When writing comments, avoid referring to temporal context about refactors or recent changes. Comments should be evergreen and describe the code as it is, not how it evolved or was recently changed.
- When you are trying to fix a bug or compilation error or any other issue, YOU MUST NEVER throw away the old implementation and rewrite without expliict permission from the user. If you are going to do this, YOU MUST STOP and get explicit permission from the user.
- NEVER name things as 'improved' or 'new' or 'enhanced', etc. Code naming should be evergreen. What is new today will be "old" someday.

## TypeScript Guidelines

- **No `any`** - ever. Use `unknown` if type is truly unknown
- **No type assertions** (`as SomeType`) unless absolutely necessary with clear justification
- **No `@ts-ignore`** or `@ts-expect-error` without explicit explanation
- These rules apply to test code as well as production code
- **Prefer `type` over `interface`** in all cases
- Use explicit typing where it aids clarity, but leverage inference where appropriate
- Utilize utility types effectively (`Pick`, `Omit`, `Partial`, `Required`, etc.)
- Create domain-specific types (e.g., `UserId`, `PaymentId`) for type safety

## Code Style

### Functional Programming

I follow a "functional light" approach:

- **No data mutation** - work with immutable data structures
- **Pure functions** wherever possible
- **Composition** as the primary mechanism for code reuse
- Avoid heavy FP abstractions (no need for complex monads or pipe/compose patterns) unless there is a clear advantage to using them
- Use array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`) over imperative loops

### Code Structure

- **No nested if/else statements** - use early returns, guard clauses, or composition
- **Avoid deep nesting** in general (max 2 levels)
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Prefer flat, readable code over clever abstractions

### Naming Conventions

- **Functions**: `camelCase`, verb-based (e.g., `calculateTotal`, `validatePayment`)
- **Types**: `PascalCase` (e.g., `PaymentRequest`, `UserProfile`)
- **Constants**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for true constants, `camelCase` for configuration
- **Files**: `camelCase.ts` for all TypeScript files, `PascalCase.tsx` for React components
- **Test files**: `*.test.ts(x)` for all test files

### Minimal Comments in Code

Code should be as self-documenting as possible through clear naming and structure. Comments should be minimal and only be used to explain complex or non-obvious code.

```typescript
// Avoid: Comments explaining what the code does
const calculateDiscount = (price: number, customer: Customer): number => {
  // Check if customer is premium
  if (customer.tier === "premium") {
    // Apply 20% discount for premium customers
    return price * 0.8;
  }
  // Regular customers get 10% discount
  return price * 0.9;
};

// Good: Self-documenting code with clear names
const PREMIUM_DISCOUNT_MULTIPLIER = 0.8;
const STANDARD_DISCOUNT_MULTIPLIER = 0.9;

const isPremiumCustomer = (customer: Customer): boolean => {
  return customer.tier === "premium";
};

const calculateDiscount = (price: number, customer: Customer): number => {
  const discountMultiplier = isPremiumCustomer(customer)
    ? PREMIUM_DISCOUNT_MULTIPLIER
    : STANDARD_DISCOUNT_MULTIPLIER;

  return price * discountMultiplier;
};

// Avoid: Complex logic with comments
const processPayment = (payment: Payment): ProcessedPayment => {
  // First validate the payment
  if (!validatePayment(payment)) {
    throw new Error("Invalid payment");
  }

  // Check if we need to apply 3D secure
  if (payment.amount > 100 && payment.card.type === "credit") {
    // Apply 3D secure for credit cards over £100
    const securePayment = apply3DSecure(payment);
    // Process the secure payment
    return executePayment(securePayment);
  }

  // Process the payment
  return executePayment(payment);
};

// Good: Extract to well-named functions
const requires3DSecure = (payment: Payment): boolean => {
  const SECURE_PAYMENT_THRESHOLD = 100;
  return (
    payment.amount > SECURE_PAYMENT_THRESHOLD && payment.card.type === "credit"
  );
};

const processPayment = (payment: Payment): ProcessedPayment => {
  if (!validatePayment(payment)) {
    throw new PaymentValidationError("Invalid payment");
  }

  const securedPayment = requires3DSecure(payment)
    ? apply3DSecure(payment)
    : payment;

  return executePayment(securedPayment);
};
```


## Development Workflow

### TDD Process - THE FUNDAMENTAL PRACTICE

**CRITICAL**: TDD is not optional. Every feature, every bug fix, every change MUST follow this process:

Follow Red-Green-Refactor strictly:

1. **Red**: Write a failing test for the desired behavior. NO PRODUCTION CODE until you have a failing test.
2. **Green**: Write the MINIMUM code to make the test pass. Resist the urge to write more than needed.
3. **Refactor**: Assess the code for improvement opportunities. If refactoring would add value, clean up the code while keeping tests green. If the code is already clean and expressive, move on.

**Common TDD Violations to Avoid:**

- Writing production code without a failing test first
- Writing multiple tests before making the first one pass
- Writing more production code than needed to pass the current test
- Skipping the refactor assessment step when code could be improved
- Adding functionality "while you're there" without a test driving it

**Remember**: If you're typing production code and there isn't a failing test demanding that code, you're not doing TDD.

#### TDD Example Workflow

```typescript
// Step 1: Red - Start with the simplest behavior
describe("Order processing", () => {
  it("should calculate total with shipping cost", () => {
    const order = createOrder({
      items: [{ price: 30, quantity: 1 }],
      shippingCost: 5.99,
    });

    const processed = processOrder(order);

    expect(processed.total).toBe(35.99);
    expect(processed.shippingCost).toBe(5.99);
  });
});

// Step 2: Green - Minimal implementation
const processOrder = (order: Order): ProcessedOrder => {
  const itemsTotal = order.items.reduce(
    (sum, item) => sum + item.price * item.quantity,
    0
  );

  return {
    ...order,
    shippingCost: order.shippingCost,
    total: itemsTotal + order.shippingCost,
  };
};

// Step 3: Red - Add test for free shipping behavior
describe("Order processing", () => {
  it("should calculate total with shipping cost", () => {
    // ... existing test
  });

  it("should apply free shipping for orders over £50", () => {
    const order = createOrder({
      items: [{ price: 60, quantity: 1 }],
      shippingCost: 5.99,
    });

    const processed = processOrder(order);

    expect(processed.shippingCost).toBe(0);
    expect(processed.total).toBe(60);
  });
});

// Step 4: Green - NOW we can add the conditional because both paths are tested
const processOrder = (order: Order): ProcessedOrder => {
  const itemsTotal = order.items.reduce(
    (sum, item) => sum + item.price * item.quantity,
    0
  );

  const shippingCost = itemsTotal > 50 ? 0 : order.shippingCost;

  return {
    ...order,
    shippingCost,
    total: itemsTotal + shippingCost,
  };
};

// Step 5: Add edge case tests to ensure 100% behavior coverage
describe("Order processing", () => {
  // ... existing tests

  it("should charge shipping for orders exactly at £50", () => {
    const order = createOrder({
      items: [{ price: 50, quantity: 1 }],
      shippingCost: 5.99,
    });

    const processed = processOrder(order);

    expect(processed.shippingCost).toBe(5.99);
    expect(processed.total).toBe(55.99);
  });
});

// Step 6: Refactor - Extract constants and improve readability
const FREE_SHIPPING_THRESHOLD = 50;

const calculateItemsTotal = (items: OrderItem[]): number => {
  return items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price * item.quantity, 0);
};

const qualifiesForFreeShipping = (itemsTotal: number): boolean => {
  return itemsTotal > FREE_SHIPPING_THRESHOLD;
};

const processOrder = (order: Order): ProcessedOrder => {
  const itemsTotal = calculateItemsTotal(order.items);
  const shippingCost = qualifiesForFreeShipping(itemsTotal)
    ? 0
    : order.shippingCost;

  return {
    ...order,
    shippingCost,
    total: itemsTotal + shippingCost,
  };
};
```

### Refactoring - The Critical Third Step

Evaluating refactoring opportunities is not optional - it's the third step in the TDD cycle. After achieving a green state and committing your work, you MUST assess whether the code can be improved. However, only refactor if there's clear value - if the code is already clean and expresses intent well, move on to the next test.

#### What is Refactoring?

Refactoring means changing the internal structure of code without changing its external behavior. The public API remains unchanged, all tests continue to pass, but the code becomes cleaner, more maintainable, or more efficient. Remember: only refactor when it genuinely improves the code - not all code needs refactoring.

#### When to Refactor

- **Always assess after green**: Once tests pass, before moving to the next test, evaluate if refactoring would add value
- **When you see duplication**: But understand what duplication really means (see DRY below)
- **When names could be clearer**: Variable names, function names, or type names that don't clearly express intent
- **When structure could be simpler**: Complex conditional logic, deeply nested code, or long functions
- **When patterns emerge**: After implementing several similar features, useful abstractions may become apparent

**Remember**: Not all code needs refactoring. If the code is already clean, expressive, and well-structured, commit and move on. Refactoring should improve the code - don't change things just for the sake of change.

#### Refactoring Guidelines

##### 1. Look for Useful Abstractions Based on Semantic Meaning

Create abstractions only when code shares the same semantic meaning and purpose. Don't abstract based on structural similarity alone - **duplicate code is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction**.

```typescript
// Similar structure, DIFFERENT semantic meaning - DO NOT ABSTRACT
const validatePaymentAmount = (amount: number): boolean => {
  return amount > 0 && amount <= 10000;
};

const validateTransferAmount = (amount: number): boolean => {
  return amount > 0 && amount <= 10000;
};

// These might have the same structure today, but they represent different
// business concepts that will likely evolve independently.
// Payment limits might change based on fraud rules.
// Transfer limits might change based on account type.
// Abstracting them couples unrelated business rules.

// Similar structure, SAME semantic meaning - SAFE TO ABSTRACT
const formatUserDisplayName = (firstName: string, lastName: string): string => {
  return `${firstName} ${lastName}`.trim();
};

const formatCustomerDisplayName = (
  firstName: string,
  lastName: string
): string => {
  return `${firstName} ${lastName}`.trim();
};

const formatEmployeeDisplayName = (
  firstName: string,
  lastName: string
): string => {
  return `${firstName} ${lastName}`.trim();
};

// These all represent the same concept: "how we format a person's name for display"
// They share semantic meaning, not just structure
const formatPersonDisplayName = (
  firstName: string,
  lastName: string
): string => {
  return `${firstName} ${lastName}`.trim();
};

// Replace all call sites throughout the codebase:
// Before:
// const userLabel = formatUserDisplayName(user.firstName, user.lastName);
// const customerName = formatCustomerDisplayName(customer.firstName, customer.lastName);
// const employeeTag = formatEmployeeDisplayName(employee.firstName, employee.lastName);

// After:
// const userLabel = formatPersonDisplayName(user.firstName, user.lastName);
// const customerName = formatPersonDisplayName(customer.firstName, customer.lastName);
// const employeeTag = formatPersonDisplayName(employee.firstName, employee.lastName);

// Then remove the original functions as they're no longer needed
```

**Questions to ask before abstracting:**

- Do these code blocks represent the same concept or different concepts that happen to look similar?
- If the business rules for one change, should the others change too?
- Would a developer reading this abstraction understand why these things are grouped together?
- Am I abstracting based on what the code IS (structure) or what it MEANS (semantics)?

**Remember**: It's much easier to create an abstraction later when the semantic relationship becomes clear than to undo a bad abstraction that couples unrelated concepts.

##### 2. Understanding DRY - It's About Knowledge, Not Code

DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) is about not duplicating **knowledge** in the system, not about eliminating all code that looks similar.

```typescript
// This is NOT a DRY violation - different knowledge despite similar code
const validateUserAge = (age: number): boolean => {
  return age >= 18 && age <= 100;
};

const validateProductRating = (rating: number): boolean => {
  return rating >= 1 && rating <= 5;
};

const validateYearsOfExperience = (years: number): boolean => {
  return years >= 0 && years <= 50;
};

// These functions have similar structure (checking numeric ranges), but they
// represent completely different business rules:
// - User age has legal requirements (18+) and practical limits (100)
// - Product ratings follow a 1-5 star system
// - Years of experience starts at 0 with a reasonable upper bound
// Abstracting them would couple unrelated business concepts and make future
// changes harder. What if ratings change to 1-10? What if legal age changes?

// Another example of code that looks similar but represents different knowledge:
const formatUserDisplayName = (user: User): string => {
  return `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`.trim();
};

const formatAddressLine = (address: Address): string => {
  return `${address.street} ${address.number}`.trim();
};

const formatCreditCardLabel = (card: CreditCard): string => {
  return `${card.type} ${card.lastFourDigits}`.trim();
};

// Despite the pattern "combine two strings with space and trim", these represent
// different domain concepts with different future evolution paths

// This IS a DRY violation - same knowledge in multiple places
class Order {
  calculateTotal(): number {
    const itemsTotal = this.items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
    const shippingCost = itemsTotal > 50 ? 0 : 5.99; // Knowledge duplicated!
    return itemsTotal + shippingCost;
  }
}

class OrderSummary {
  getShippingCost(itemsTotal: number): number {
    return itemsTotal > 50 ? 0 : 5.99; // Same knowledge!
  }
}

class ShippingCalculator {
  calculate(orderAmount: number): number {
    if (orderAmount > 50) return 0; // Same knowledge again!
    return 5.99;
  }
}

// Refactored - knowledge in one place
const FREE_SHIPPING_THRESHOLD = 50;
const STANDARD_SHIPPING_COST = 5.99;

const calculateShippingCost = (itemsTotal: number): number => {
  return itemsTotal > FREE_SHIPPING_THRESHOLD ? 0 : STANDARD_SHIPPING_COST;
};

// Now all classes use the single source of truth
class Order {
  calculateTotal(): number {
    const itemsTotal = this.items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
    return itemsTotal + calculateShippingCost(itemsTotal);
  }
}
```

##### 3. Maintain External APIs During Refactoring

Refactoring must never break existing consumers of your code:

```typescript
// Original implementation
export const processPayment = (payment: Payment): ProcessedPayment => {
  // Complex logic all in one function
  if (payment.amount <= 0) {
    throw new Error("Invalid amount");
  }

  if (payment.amount > 10000) {
    throw new Error("Amount too large");
  }

  // ... 50 more lines of validation and processing

  return result;
};

// Refactored - external API unchanged, internals improved
export const processPayment = (payment: Payment): ProcessedPayment => {
  validatePaymentAmount(payment.amount);
  validatePaymentMethod(payment.method);

  const authorizedPayment = authorizePayment(payment);
  const capturedPayment = capturePayment(authorizedPayment);

  return generateReceipt(capturedPayment);
};

// New internal functions - not exported
const validatePaymentAmount = (amount: number): void => {
  if (amount <= 0) {
    throw new Error("Invalid amount");
  }

  if (amount > 10000) {
    throw new Error("Amount too large");
  }
};

// Tests continue to pass without modification because external API unchanged
```

##### 4. Verify and Commit After Refactoring

**CRITICAL**: After every refactoring:

1. Run all tests - they must pass without modification
2. Run static analysis (linting, type checking) - must pass

```bash
# After refactoring
npm run test          # All tests must pass
npm run lint      # All linting must pass
npm run type-check # TypeScript must be happy
```

#### Refactoring Checklist

Before considering refactoring complete, verify:

- [ ] The refactoring actually improves the code (if not, don't refactor)
- [ ] All tests still pass without modification
- [ ] All static analysis tools pass (linting, type checking)
- [ ] No new public APIs were added (only internal ones)
- [ ] Code is more readable than before
- [ ] Any duplication removed was duplication of knowledge, not just code
- [ ] No speculative abstractions were created
- [ ] The refactoring is committed separately from feature changes

#### Example Refactoring Session

```typescript
// After getting tests green with minimal implementation:
describe("Order processing", () => {
  it("calculates total with items and shipping", () => {
    const order = { items: [{ price: 30 }, { price: 20 }], shipping: 5 };
    expect(calculateOrderTotal(order)).toBe(55);
  });

  it("applies free shipping over £50", () => {
    const order = { items: [{ price: 30 }, { price: 25 }], shipping: 5 };
    expect(calculateOrderTotal(order)).toBe(55);
  });
});

// Green implementation (minimal):
const calculateOrderTotal = (order: Order): number => {
  const itemsTotal = order.items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
  const shipping = itemsTotal > 50 ? 0 : order.shipping;
  return itemsTotal + shipping;
};

// Assess refactoring opportunities:
// - The variable names could be clearer
// - The free shipping threshold is a magic number
// - The calculation logic could be extracted for clarity
// These improvements would add value, so proceed with refactoring:

const FREE_SHIPPING_THRESHOLD = 50;

const calculateItemsTotal = (items: OrderItem[]): number => {
  return items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
};

const calculateShipping = (
  baseShipping: number,
  itemsTotal: number
): number => {
  return itemsTotal > FREE_SHIPPING_THRESHOLD ? 0 : baseShipping;
};

const calculateOrderTotal = (order: Order): number => {
  const itemsTotal = calculateItemsTotal(order.items);
  const shipping = calculateShipping(order.shipping, itemsTotal);
  return itemsTotal + shipping;
};

// Run tests - they still pass!
// Run linting - all clean!
// Run type checking - no errors!
```

##### Example: When NOT to Refactor

```typescript
// After getting this test green:
describe("Discount calculation", () => {
  it("should apply 10% discount", () => {
    const originalPrice = 100;
    const discountedPrice = applyDiscount(originalPrice, 0.1);
    expect(discountedPrice).toBe(90);
  });
});

// Green implementation:
const applyDiscount = (price: number, discountRate: number): number => {
  return price * (1 - discountRate);
};

// Assess refactoring opportunities:
// - Code is already simple and clear
// - Function name clearly expresses intent
// - Implementation is a straightforward calculation
// - No magic numbers or unclear logic
// Conclusion: No refactoring needed. This is fine as-is.
```

# Getting help

- ALWAYS ask for clarification rather than making assumptions. Give me multiple options to chose from, labeled A, B, C, etc, to make it easier for me to choose the best option.
- If you're having trouble with something, it's ok to stop and ask for help. Especially if it's something your human might be better at.

# Testing

- Tests MUST cover the functionality being implemented.
- NEVER ignore the output of the system or the tests - Logs and messages often contain CRITICAL information.
- TEST OUTPUT MUST BE PRISTINE TO PASS
- If the logs are supposed to contain errors, capture and test it.


## We practice TDD. That means:

- Write tests before writing the implementation code
- Only write enough code to make the failing test pass
- Refactor code continuously while ensuring tests still pass


### TDD Implementation Process

- Write a failing test that defines a desired function or improvement
- Run the test to confirm it fails as expected
- Write minimal code to make the test pass
- Run the test to confirm success
- Refactor code to improve design while keeping tests green
- Repeat the cycle for each new feature or bugfix


## Testing Principles

## Behavior-Driven Testing

- **No "unit tests"** - this term is not helpful. Tests should verify expected behavior, treating implementation as a black box
- Test through the public API exclusively - internals should be invisible to tests
- No 1:1 mapping between test files and implementation files
- Tests that examine internal implementation details are wasteful and should be avoided
- **Coverage targets**: 100% coverage should be expected at all times, but these tests must ALWAYS be based on business behaviour, not implementation details
- Tests must document expected business behaviour

## Testing Tools

- **Vitest** for testing frameworks
- **React Testing Library** for React components
- All test code must follow the same TypeScript strict mode rules as production code
